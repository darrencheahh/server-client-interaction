# server-client-interaction
This programming project is about trying to observe how servers and client servers and how they interact. 

I was tasked to create a Client.java file and Server.java and made them interact through socket and server socket. 

I also implemented functionalities such as list and put. 
- The list functionality allows clients to list all the files placed inside a directory known as serverFiles. 
- The put functionality allows clients to upload and copy all the contents within a file inside the directory serverFiles.
